# Step Functions 

## 7 types of states
1. A `Task` state ("Type": "Task") represents a single unit of work performed by a state machine. All work in your state machine is done by [Tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/amazon-states-language-task-state.html). A task performs work by using an activity or an AWS Lambda function, or by passing parameters to the API actions of other services.
